# Connect4
# Implemented this project as a part of Artificial Intelligence coursework in C++. 
# Developed programs by implementing MIN-MAX-AB and ALPHA-BETA-SEARCH Algorithms.  
# Created 3 evaluation functions and analyzed the performance of each evaluation function with each algorithm tabulating the total length of the game path, 
# total number of nodes generated and expanded, execution time, the size of memory used by the program, and winning/losing statistics
